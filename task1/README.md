## Connectionist Text Proposal Network <a name="model"/>

### Overview <a name="overview"/>

This is a pytorch implementation of
the [Detecting Text in Natural Image with Connectionist Text Proposal Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03605)
proposed in 2016 by:

> Zhi Tian, Weilin Huang, Tong He, Pan He, Yu Qiao.

The original repository implemented in [Tensorflow library](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) can be found
at [Tensorflow source code](https://github.com/tianzhi0549/CTPN).

### Introduction <a name="intro"/>

Here is a novel Connectionist Text Proposal Network (CTPN) that accurately localizes text lines in natural image. The
CTPN detects a text line in a sequence of fine-scale text proposals directly in convolutional feature maps. A vertical
anchor mechanism that jointly predicts location and text/non-text score of each fixed-width proposal, considerably
improving localization accuracy.

The sequential proposals are naturally connected by a recurrent neural network, which is seamlessly incorporated into
the convolutional network, resulting in an end-to-end trainable model. This allows the CTPN to explore rich context
information of image, making it powerful to detect extremely ambiguous text. The CTPN works reliably on multi-scale and
multi- language text without further post-processing, departing from previous bottom-up methods requiring multi-step
post-processing.

## Training <a name="training"/>

Here are examples of running the [train.py](./train.py):

> Do not forget the commands to run on GPU below can be used with --use-amp argument if you want to use the automatic mixed precision.

### Single CPU <a name="single-cpu-training"/>

Be aware that it is not recommended doing the training on CPU!

```
python text_localization/ctpn/train.py
```

### Single GPU <a name="single-gpu-training"/>

```
python text_localization/ctpn/train.py --use-cuda --gpu-device 0
```

## Demo <a name="demo"/>

After having downloaded the CTPN model's weights in this [section](../../README.md#results) and saved in this
location: `/path/to/the/checkpoint/pth/file`, you can do the prediction on the images in `text_localization/demo/images`
. The predicted images with their corresponding drawn bounding boxes and annotations (in txt format) will be saved
under `text_localization/demo/results` by defauts. All the prediction events will be saved
under `text_localization/ctpn/outputs` by defaults as well.

### Single CPU <a name="single-cpu-demo"/>

## Evaluation <a name="evaluation"/>

As it was mentioned in the [demo section](#demo), you can do the evaluation on the 361 images (do not forget to download
the weights). When it is finished, the provided [SROIE 2019 script](../../scripts/sroie2019/evaluation/script.py) will
be automatically executed to compute the recall, precision and hmean. As in the prediction events, all the evaluation
events (logs, submit.zip and so on) will be saved under `text_localization/ctpn/outputs`.

&nbsp;

As one can notice, this implementation of the CTPN is slightly different from the paper and here are the changes:

1. The number of channels of the RPN layer (The one that slides through the last convolutional maps (`conv5`)of the
   VGG16 model) is 256 instead of 512. This helps in setting large image size during training.

2. Another layer was added to help to get better predictions. That layer is just a concatenation of the regression and
   classification layers.

3. The weight initialization is the `Kaiming initialization` or `He initialization` for all layers except for
   the `BiLSTM`. The `BiLSTM` weight initialization is based on this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00071.

4. The actual CTPN anchor matching method was not enough to match all ground truth boxes (by the time I checked the
   matched anchors during training, there were some images where some texts did not have any anchors matched). That is
   why the threshold for positive anchors was decreased from 0.7 to 0.5 and from 0.5 to 0.3 for negative anchors in
   order to increase the average number of matched anchors.

5. The negative and positive ratio was changed from `1:1` to `3:1`. It was found that this leads to faster optimization
   and a more stable training.

6. The regression loss used in the CTPN is the smooth L1 loss. Altough it is a good loss, it is not free from outliers.
   That is why the balanced L1 loss was used.

7. Because of the imbalance between the number of positive and negative anchors, `Î»1` from the regression loss is set to
   4 to balance the loss terms.

8. The data augmentation strategy described in the SSD paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325 was used to generate many
   more training samples as the SROIE dataset is very small (less than 1000 images and annotations).

In order to improve my results, here are two potentials solutions I can think of:

1. Multi-scale testing.
2. Implementation of the side-refinement approach.

## TODO <a name="todo"/>

Here is a to-do list which should be complete subsequently.

* [ ] Implementation of the multi-scale testing.
* [ ] Implementation of the side-refinement approach.
